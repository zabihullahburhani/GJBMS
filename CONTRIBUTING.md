# 🤝 Contributing to Gold and Jewelry Business Management System

Welcome! 🌿  
We’re excited to have you contribute to our project. Please read these guidelines carefully to keep our work clean, organized, and collaborative.

---

## 🧩 Branch Strategy
We use separate branches for different parts of the project:
- `frontend` – UI templates, CSS, JS
- `backend` – FastAPI, routes, authentication logic
- `database` – SQLite schema, CRUD, data scripts

> **DO NOT** push directly to `main`.  
> Always create a branch or open a Pull Request (PR).

## ✏️ Commit Message Convention
Use clear and meaningful commit messages with prefixes:
- `feat:` – Add new feature (e.g., `feat: add admin dashboard page`)
- `fix:` – Fix a bug (e.g., `fix: correct login redirect`)
- `docs:` – Documentation (e.g., `docs: update README`)
- `style:` – Code formatting, CSS (e.g., `style: improve button style`)
- `refactor:` – Refactor code (e.g., `refactor: simplify token creation`)
- `test:` – Add or fix tests
- `chore:` – Minor changes, config files
